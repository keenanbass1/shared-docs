# Human rights in America and China: A comparative analysis beyond Western framing

Both the United States and China have committed severe human rights violations, though they differ fundamentally in type, documentation, and structure. The US record includes **mass incarceration of 2 million people** with extreme racial disparities, documented police killings averaging over 1,100 annually, and international interventions causing an estimated **4.5 million total deaths** in post-9/11 wars alone. China’s record includes **detention of an estimated 800,000 to 1.5 million Uyghurs** in what the UN determined “may constitute crimes against humanity,” suppression in Tibet and Hong Kong, and internal campaigns during the Mao era causing **15-55 million deaths** in the Great Leap Forward. Neither country emerges as clearly superior across all dimensions—the US shows better transparency and civil liberties protections but worse outcomes on incarceration, healthcare access, and international military conduct, while China demonstrates remarkable poverty reduction and improving mortality statistics but severe restrictions on political freedom and minority rights.

## Domestic human rights: Distinct patterns of systemic abuse

**United States**: The American carceral system represents the world’s largest experiment in mass incarceration. With **nearly 2 million people imprisoned** and an incarceration rate of 541 per 100,000—the fifth highest globally—the US holds 5% of the world’s population but 20% of its prisoners.  The racial dimension is stark: Black Americans face an imprisonment rate of **1,218 per 100,000**, compared to 231 for white Americans—a 5.3-to-1 disparity. An estimated 55,000-62,500 people spend more than 15 days in solitary confinement on any given day, a practice the UN considers potential torture.

Police violence compounds these concerns. Washington Post data documents **10,429 fatal police shootings** between 2015-2024, with 2024’s 1,173 deaths representing a record high. Black Americans are killed at rates 2.5 times higher than white Americans.  The Lancet estimates more than half of deaths from police violence went unreported in official statistics during 1980-2018.

Historical atrocities remain relevant context. The federal investigation into Indigenous boarding schools found “rampant” physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, with the Washington Post documenting **3,000+ child deaths**—three times the officially acknowledged figure. The population of Indigenous peoples in the Americas declined by more than 80% by 1900. Japanese American internment affected **120,000 people**, 62% of whom were US citizens.  Slavery and its successor system of Jim Crow created lasting wealth gaps— white households today hold **ten times more wealth** than Black households.

**China**: The Xinjiang situation represents China’s most severe contemporary human rights crisis. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded in August 2022 that “serious human rights violations” occurred, with actions that “may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.”  Estimates of detention range from 449,000 currently imprisoned to over 1.5 million at peak.  Documented evidence includes torture, sexual violence, forced sterilization, and forced contraception.  Birth rates in Xinjiang fell **24% in 2019** compared to 4.2% nationally, with some regions experiencing 60%+ declines. 

In Tibet, Human Rights Watch documented accelerated forced urbanization affecting **930,000+ rural Tibetans**,  with over 1 million children separated from families into boarding schools where Tibetan language is marginalized. Religious restrictions include bans on public prayers for the Dalai Lama and required “political education” in monasteries.

Hong Kong’s National Security Law has led to **316 arrests**  with a 91% conviction rate for those charged.  Amnesty International found 85% of cases involved “legitimate forms of expression.”  An estimated 500,000 people emigrated between 2021-2024, with profound implications for press freedom and civil society.

## Economic inequality: Similar metrics, different trajectories

Both countries exhibit high income inequality. China’s official Gini coefficient of **0.465** (2023)  and America’s approximately 0.47-0.49 both exceed the UN’s “warning level” of 0.40 for social unrest risk. However, their trajectories differ significantly.

China’s inequality peaked at 0.491 in 2008 and has declined through the 2010s, while absolute incomes for nearly all groups rose rapidly. The US Gini has increased roughly 10% since 1990, representing the highest inequality among G7 nations. Wealth concentration at the very top is more extreme in America—the **top 1% owns approximately 34-39%** of US wealth  compared to about 30% in China, while the US top 0.1% owns 22% versus roughly 10% in China.

China’s poverty reduction claims warrant serious examination. The World Bank confirms that **800+ million people** were lifted from extreme poverty between 1980-2020, accounting for approximately 75% of global poverty reduction— a historically unprecedented achievement.  The poverty rate at $1.90/day fell from 88% (1981) to 0.7% (2015).  However, methodological debates persist: China’s national poverty line of approximately $2.30/day PPP  is relatively low, Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged in 2020 that 600 million Chinese earn roughly $140 monthly,  and the rural-urban income gap remains substantial at 2.4:1.

The US maintains a supplemental poverty rate of 12.9% (2024), with child poverty fluctuating dramatically based on policy.  The expanded Child Tax Credit drove child poverty to a historic low of 5.2% in 2021,  but its expiration caused a 163% increase—6+ million more children in poverty by 2022-2023. 

Billionaire wealth concentration differs: the US has **902 billionaires**  with total wealth exceeding $5 trillion, while China has 516-814 (depending on methodology) with approximately $3 trillion. The US accounts for 39% of global millionaires versus China’s 11%.

## Quality of life reveals surprising patterns

Healthcare and mortality statistics challenge simplistic narratives. Life expectancy is now nearly equivalent—**78.4 years in the US versus 78.0-78.5 in China**—but the trajectories diverge sharply. US life expectancy declined 2.4 years between 2019-2021 (the largest two-year drop since the 1920s), driven by COVID-19, drug overdoses, and other factors. China’s has steadily increased 3.8 years over 2010-2023. 

China now reports lower child mortality than the United States—**4.0 per 1,000 live births versus 5.4-5.5**— representing a dramatic improvement from approximately 30 per 1,000 in the early 2000s. However, maternal mortality rates are similar, with the US slightly better (19.85 vs 20.4 per 100,000). 

Healthcare access shows complex tradeoffs. China has achieved **over 95% basic insurance coverage**  compared to America’s 92% (with 27 million uninsured). However, out-of-pocket costs remain high in China at 35-40% of total health spending  versus 11% in the US. The US spends approximately **$13,000 per capita** on healthcare—the highest globally—yet achieves worse outcomes on many measures than peer countries. Significant urban-rural gaps exist in both countries; Beijing’s life expectancy of 80 years contrasts with Tibet’s 68 years.

Suicide rates reveal a dramatic divergence.  China’s rate has **declined 64%** from approximately 23 per 100,000 (1999) to 8.6 (2017)— among the most dramatic reductions globally. The US rate has **increased 33%** from 10.5 to 14-16.1 over the same period. Gun access is a major factor—60% of US suicides involve firearms  versus 0.1% in China. 

Homelessness comparisons are complicated by definitional differences. The US counted a record **771,480 homeless** in January 2024 (an 18% annual increase), with 36% unsheltered. China’s official count of approximately 2.6 million street homeless obscures the reality of 290 million migrant workers living in cities without legal urban residency rights, often in substandard conditions. 

Working conditions diverge significantly. China’s “996” culture (9am-9pm, 6 days/week) remains widespread in the tech sector  despite being ruled illegal in 2021.  The US has no federal mandates for paid vacation, parental leave, or sick leave—unique among developed nations. China requires 5-15 days paid vacation and 98+ days maternity leave, though enforcement varies. Average weekly hours are 36.4 in the US versus 44+ in China.

## Geopolitical and historical atrocities: Comparative scale

**United States international conduct**: American foreign interventions have caused casualties on a massive scale. The documented CIA-backed coups include Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954),  Chile  (1973), and involvement in Operation Condor—the multinational assassination program in South America  with at least 654 documented transnational victims. Guatemala’s subsequent military regimes killed an estimated **100,000+ civilians** through 1990. 

World War II conduct included the Tokyo firebombing (March 1945), which killed **88,000-200,000 civilians** depending on the estimate, and the broader firebombing campaign that killed approximately 330,000 Japanese civilians and left 8 million homeless. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused **150,000-246,000 deaths** by the end of 1945, with ongoing health effects documented by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation. 

The Vietnam War’s impact was devastating: approximately **20 million gallons of herbicides** sprayed on 5 million acres, affecting an estimated 4.8 million Vietnamese. Vietnam reports 400,000 deaths or permanent injuries and 500,000 babies born with birth defects from Agent Orange. The Cambodia bombing campaign dropped **2.76 million tons of bombs** in what historians argue contributed to the Khmer Rouge’s rise.  

Post-9/11 wars have caused an estimated **905,000-940,000 direct deaths** including more than 432,000 civilians, with an additional 3.6-3.8 million indirect deaths from disease, displacement, and infrastructure destruction—totaling approximately **4.5-4.7 million deaths**. The Iraq Body Count documents 186,901-210,296 violent civilian deaths, while peer-reviewed surveys suggest higher figures.

Iraq sanctions (1990-2003) remain contested. UNICEF surveys indicated 500,000 excess child deaths, though post-2003 surveys suggest substantially lower figures. Two UN Humanitarian Coordinators resigned in protest, with one calling sanctions “genocidal.” 

Nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands involved **67 tests with 100 megatons total yield**—equivalent to 7,000 Hiroshima bombs—displacing entire populations  and causing elevated cancer rates. 

**China’s historical and international conduct**: Internal campaigns under Mao caused deaths that dwarf modern conflicts. The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) caused an estimated **15-55 million deaths**, with the most commonly cited scholarly figure being 30-36 million. Stanford sociologist Andrew Walder estimates 2.5 million died from beatings, torture, and summary execution during this period. The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) caused an estimated **1.1-3 million deaths** with 22-30 million subjected to political persecution, with Walder noting “the vast majority of casualties were due to state repression.”

The Sino-Vietnamese War (1979) caused approximately **26,000-30,000 Chinese deaths and 20,000-35,000 Vietnamese deaths** in just one month, plus over 10,000 reported civilian casualties.

Belt and Road Initiative debt concerns are debated. The Wilson Center notes 80% of China’s government loans go to nations in debt distress, but Chatham House concluded “evidence for ‘debt-trap diplomacy’ views is limited” and that Chinese lending systems are “too fragmented” for strategic debt entrapment. Chinese lenders account for 12% of Africa’s external debt—lower than multilateral institutions. 

South China Sea activities violate international law. The 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled China’s “nine-dash line” claims have no legal basis under UNCLOS  and that China caused “severe harm to the coral reef environment.” China rejected the ruling entirely. 

China maintains support for North Korea (90%+ of its trade) with documented sanctions evasion, and has provided Myanmar’s junta with fighter jets, surveillance technology, and diplomatic cover after initially calling the 2021 coup a “cabinet reshuffle.”

## Equality dimensions across categories

**Gender equality**: China’s female labor force participation of 60% exceeds the US in absolute terms but has declined from 73.2% (1990). Political representation shows stark patterns—China has **zero women on its 24-member Politburo** for the first time in two decades and no woman has ever sat on the Politburo Standing Committee. The US has approximately 28% women in Congress. The WEF Global Gender Gap Index ranks China 103rd of 148 countries and the US 43rd. The US gender pay gap shows women earning 81-85 cents per dollar earned by men, with intersectional disparities much worse for women of color (54 cents for Latinas).

**LGBTQ+ rights**: The US maintains legal same-sex marriage nationwide but faces an unprecedented wave of restrictions—over **500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills** introduced annually since 2023, with 40-85 passing into law each year.  More than half of US states now ban best-practice medical care for transgender youth.  China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 but has no same-sex marriage, no anti-discrimination protections, and censors LGBTQ+ media content. Notably, 52% of Chinese respondents now support same-sex marriage according to Williams Institute surveys.

**Disability rights**: US employment-population ratio for people with disabilities is 22.7% versus 65.5% for those without.  China’s 85 million people with disabilities  face similar employment challenges despite legal quotas, with over 20% of disabled persons aged 15-29 struggling with literacy. 

**Racial and ethnic inequality**: The US exhibits extreme racial wealth gaps— white households hold **ten times more wealth** than Black households.  Hate crimes reached record highs in 2023-2024 with 11,679 incidents, 53% motivated by race/ethnicity.  China’s treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans, and other minorities constitutes severe discrimination, while its treatment of the 55 officially recognized minorities varies—some receive affirmative action-type benefits while others face cultural suppression.

## Non-Western perspectives challenge both countries

Global South scholars offer critical perspectives on both powers. Kenyan legal scholar Makau Mutua argues the human rights corpus is “fundamentally Eurocentric”  and serves as a “civilizing crusade,”  with the International Criminal Court exemplifying how “the Global North prosecutes and the Global South obeys.”  The 1993 Bangkok Declaration  and African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights represent attempts to develop alternative frameworks emphasizing collective rights, development, and cultural context. 

However, these alternative frameworks face internal critique. Indian economist Amartya Sen argued Asian values cannot operate coherently given Asia’s “overwhelming cultural diversity” and accused proponents of using cultural relativism as “doublespeak for suppressing freedom of speech.” Former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung similarly criticized selective invocation of Asian values by authoritarian governments. 

Both the US and China face criticism from Global South scholars. The US is criticized for interventionism, support for authoritarian regimes during the Cold War, selective application of human rights standards, and over-emphasis on civil/political rights at the expense of economic/social rights. China is criticized for Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet, potential neo-colonial practices in Africa, and using development rhetoric to avoid accountability.

Chinese development assistance resonates in parts of Africa precisely because it comes “less constrained by governance and human-rights standards” compared to Western aid. However, African scholars also critique China for “perpetuating a neo-colonial relationship” based on raw material exports, poor labor conditions, and job displacement.

## Structural comparison: Intent, scale, and transparency

The nature of human rights violations differs fundamentally between these systems. US abuses often result from **structural inequality and neglect** embedded in decentralized systems—mass incarceration reflects policy choices by thousands of jurisdictions, police violence reflects inadequate accountability mechanisms, and poverty reflects gaps in social programs. Chinese abuses often reflect **centralized state policy**—the Xinjiang camps were organized through government directives, Hong Kong’s NSL was imposed from Beijing, and censorship is systematic.

On **scale**, both countries have caused deaths in the millions when considering historical and international actions. The Great Leap Forward’s 15-55 million deaths exceeds US-caused casualties, but post-9/11 wars’ 4.5 million deaths and historical interventions (Vietnam, Latin America, WWII bombing) represent enormous tolls. Domestically, US mass incarceration affects more people currently (2 million) than documented political prisoners in China (thousands to low millions, estimates vary).

**Transparency** differs dramatically. The US publishes detailed, often unflattering data—CDC mortality statistics, FBI crime data, Census Bureau inequality figures, Washington Post police shooting databases. China classifies death tolls as state secrets, restricts independent access to Xinjiang and Tibet, and produces statistics that external researchers often question.

## Conclusion: Beyond simplistic rankings

Any honest comparative assessment reveals that neither country can claim moral superiority across all dimensions. The United States maintains stronger civil liberties protections, press freedom, and transparency but has caused massive casualties through international interventions, operates the world’s largest incarceration system with severe racial disparities, and fails to provide basic social protections common in peer nations. China has achieved historically unprecedented poverty reduction and improving health outcomes but engages in systematic repression of minorities, dissidents, and religious practitioners that may constitute crimes against humanity.

The most productive framework may be the one Global South scholars advocate: recognizing that human rights frameworks themselves remain contested, that both countries apply standards selectively, and that genuine assessment requires examining economic, social, and cultural rights alongside civil and political freedoms.  Non-Western perspectives remind us that neither American-style individual rights nor Chinese-style development-first approaches fully address human dignity—and that the power to define what counts as a “human rights violation” has historically resided with those least likely to face consequences for their own abuses.
