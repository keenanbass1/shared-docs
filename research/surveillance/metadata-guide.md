# What Australian Authorities Know About You

## A Guide to Metadata Surveillance in Australia

### 📱 **What Metadata IS Collected (No Warrant Required)**

• **Location data** - Which cell tower you connected through (your approximate location)
• **Device identifiers** - IMEI numbers, SIM card details
• **Call type** - Voice, SMS, MMS, voicemail

*Note: They DON’T get the content of calls or messages without a warrant, but they know everything else*

#### **Internet Activity**

• **IP addresses** - Every IP you’ve connected from

• **Website connections** - IP addresses of sites visited (though not specific pages)
• **Device MAC addresses** - Unique identifiers of your devices

#### **Location Tracking**

• **Cell tower connections** - Creates a map of your movements

### 🛡️ **What You Should Know**

#### **Key Facts:**

• **No notification required** - You’ll never know if your data was accessed
• **No judicial oversight** - Agencies self-authorize most requests
• **Retroactive searches** - Can examine your past 2 years instantly
• **Pattern analysis** - AI systems identify “suspicious” behaviors
• **Parallel construction** - Metadata used to build cases, then hidden from court
• **Third-party doctrine** - Data held by companies has less protection

#### **The Reality:**

• **330,000+ warrantless accesses** occur annually
• Average person’s metadata accessed **without their knowledge**
• Takes **less than 30 seconds** to pull your complete profile
• **No probable cause** required - just “relevance” to investigation
• Can be accessed for **civil matters** not just criminal

### ⚖️ **Legal Protections (Limited)**

#### **What Requires a Warrant:**

• Content of communications (usually)

• Installing surveillance devices
• Journalist’s sources (supposed to, but violated)

#### **What Doesn’t Require a Warrant:**

• Everything listed above as metadata
• Historical location data
• Financial records via AUSTRAC
• Social media monitoring
• Public CCTV/facial recognition

### 🔮 **Future Capabilities Being Deployed**

• **AI behavioral prediction** - Identifying “pre-crime” patterns
• **Social credit scoring** - Aggregating all data sources

• **IoT device monitoring** - Smart home data collection
• **Vehicle telematics** - Real-time car tracking
• **Health data integration** - My Health Record access
• **Digital ID system** - Centralizing all government data

### 📍 **The Bottom Line**

**They likely know:**
