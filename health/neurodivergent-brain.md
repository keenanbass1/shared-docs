# A Critical Map of Neurodivergencies

## A Working Framework for Personal Research

This document provides a structured critical analysis of neurodivergent conditions, centering neurodiversity-affirming and critical psychiatry perspectives while maintaining scientific rigor. It is designed as an iterable framework with placeholders for expansion.

# Part I: Foundational Critiques

## 1. The ontological status of psychiatric categories

The question of whether conditions like ADHD, autism, bipolar disorder, and BPD represent discrete “natural kinds” or pragmatic groupings sits at the heart of psychiatric philosophy. **No consensus exists**, but several competing positions structure the debate:

**Essentialist/Natural Kinds View** holds that psychiatric categories have identity-determining properties all members share—that classification “carves nature at its joints.” This implies diseases are *discovered* through scientific inquiry, similar to infectious diseases.

**Nominalism** argues psychodiagnostic constructs are “nothing but conventional common names” invented on pragmatic grounds. Categories are useful fictions, not real entities.  Where the boundary falls between disorder and typical behavior is “ultimately a political and social choice, not a scientific one.”

**Mechanistic Property Clusters (MPC)**, proposed by Kendler et al. (2011), suggests psychiatric disorders are unified not by shared essences but by *causal relations* among features—no single underlying cause, but clusters of causally connected properties. This accommodates heterogeneity while preserving some ontological status.

**Network models** (Borsboom, 2017) propose mental disorders arise from direct causal interactions between symptoms themselves, not from latent underlying disease entities. Disorders become self-sustaining symptom networks stuck in alternative stable states.

### The presentation-vs-mechanism problem

Current DSM diagnoses are **syndrome-based**: collections of observable symptoms that cluster together. Critics argue this approach groups heterogeneous populations based on surface similarities while masking important underlying differences. As Thomas Insel (former NIMH Director) stated, DSM diagnoses are “based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure” and “lack validity.”

The RDoC initiative explicitly aims to move from symptom-based to mechanism-based classification, but this remains aspirational. **After decades of research, no biological marker reliably correlates with any major psychiatric diagnosis.**

### Historical construction of categories

Categories are not timeless discoveries but historically contingent constructions:

- **Autism** evolved from a symptom of schizophrenia (Bleuler, 1911) → distinct childhood condition (Kanner, 1943) → spectrum disorder (DSM-5, 2013). Each reconceptualization substantially changed who counts as “autistic.”
- **ADHD** transformed from “Minimal Brain Dysfunction” (1950s) → “Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood” (DSM-II) → “Attention Deficit Disorder” (DSM-III) → current formulation, with focus shifting from motor symptoms to attention based on research politics.
- **Homosexuality** was a mental disorder until 1973, demonstrating categories respond to social change, not just scientific discovery.

## 2. Critique of diagnostic frameworks

### DSM/ICD limitations

**Reliability problems**: DSM-5 field trials produced notably low kappa reliability estimates (0.2-0.4), which the Task Force redefined as “acceptable” despite historically requiring ≥0.6. Allen Frances (DSM-IV Chair) stated the manual “flunked its reliability tests.” 

**The false positives problem**: DSM criteria conflate normal sadness with pathological depression by ignoring context. Over **636,120 symptom presentations** can satisfy DSM-5 PTSD criteria.  Thresholds (e.g., 5 of 9 symptoms for 2 weeks = depression) lack biological justification.

**Cultural bias**: Criteria developed primarily in Western contexts, with increasing recognition that the “Americanization of mental illness” represents a form of colonial psychiatry.

### Pharmaceutical industry influence

Financial entanglement between DSM development and pharmaceutical interests is substantial:

- **56% of DSM-IV panel members** had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies 
- **100% of Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia panels** had industry ties  
- **DSM-5**: 70% of task force members reported industry relationships
- **DSM-5-TR**: 60% of panel members received industry payments totaling **$14.2 million** over 2016-19 

“What is considered diagnosable directly impacts the sale of drugs.”  Expanding diagnostic boundaries creates new markets. Frances warned “new psychiatric diagnoses are now potentially more dangerous than new psychiatric drugs.” 

### Alternative frameworks

|Framework         |Core Approach                                                                                                                                                                                          |Status                                         |
|——————|-——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————|————————————————|
|**HiTOP**         |Dimensional, hierarchical taxonomy based on observed symptom covariation; Six spectra (Internalizing, Thought Disorder, Disinhibited Externalizing, Antagonistic Externalizing, Detachment, Somatoform)|Research consortium, 160+ members              |

|**P-factor**      |General psychopathology dimension explaining covariation across all disorders                                                                                                                          |Well-replicated finding, interpretation debated|
|**Network models**|Symptoms as causally connected nodes, disorders as self-sustaining networks                                                                                                                            |Growing theoretical influence                  |

**The p-factor** deserves particular attention: Caspi & Moffitt found all psychiatric disorders better explained by one General Psychopathology dimension than separate factors. Higher p-scores associate with earlier onset, persistence, worse developmental history, and compromised early brain function. This questions whether searching for disorder-specific causes is fundamentally misguided.

## 3. Critical psychiatry perspectives

### Classical anti-psychiatry

**Thomas Szasz** (*The Myth of Mental Illness*, 1961) argued only physical illnesses with demonstrable lesions constitute true diseases. “Mental illness” describes “problems in living”—ethical, social, and interpersonal difficulties. Psychiatric classification serves as social control disguised under medical terminology.

**R.D. Laing** emphasized schizophrenia emerges from fragmented sense of self in “unlivable situations.” His famous dictum: “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”  Madness may be “breakthrough” as much as breakdown. 

**Erving Goffman** (*Asylums*, 1961) demonstrated that mental hospitals function as “total institutions.”   His central thesis: “The most important factor in forming a mental-hospital patient is the institution, not the illness.” 

### Foucault on madness

Michel Foucault’s *Madness and Civilization* (1961) documented the 17th-century “Great Confinement” when madness became grouped with broader “social deviancy” defined by relationship to work/labor.  The mad were confined alongside vagrants, the poor, prostitutes—all sharing failure to participate in productive labor. 

**Key arguments**:

- Reason is constituted through the exclusion of madness
- The 18th-century “humanitarian” reforms that removed physical chains replaced them with “invisible chains”—moral restraints that further invalidated mad experience 
- Our medicalized understanding of mental illness is a “social invention, localized to our episteme”—not a timeless discovery 

### Contemporary critical psychiatry

**The Critical Psychiatry Network** (UK, founded 1999) challenges assumptions of biological psychiatry while advocating for reform. 

**Joanna Moncrieff** proposes the “drug-centered” model: psychiatric drugs cause alterations that may coincidentally relieve symptoms (like alcohol relieving social anxiety through disinhibition) rather than correcting hypothetical chemical abnormalities. Her 2022 umbrella review found **“no convincing evidence that depression is caused by serotonin abnormalities”**—despite 85-90% of the public believing this “chemical imbalance” explanation. 

**Mad Pride and psychiatric survivor movements** reclaim terms like “mad” as positive identity markers, parallel to LGBTQ+ reclamation of “queer.”  The movement centers **epistemic justice**: patient testimony is systematically discounted as symptom rather than valid communication.

### Key critiques synthesized

## 4. Neurodiversity-affirming perspectives

### The neurodiversity paradigm

**Nick Walker’s framework** distinguishes the **pathology paradigm** (one “right” way for brains to function; divergence = something wrong) from the **neurodiversity paradigm** (neurological diversity is natural and valuable; no single “right” way for minds to function).

The neurodiversity concept emerged collectively in online autistic communities in the mid-1990s.  Judy Singer’s 1998 thesis formalized it academically,  framing neurodiversity as analogous to biodiversity—both essential for stability. **Robert Chapman** traces the pathology paradigm to Francis Galton’s 1869 work synthesizing statistical normality with Darwinian evolution—the foundation of eugenics.

### The social model applied

The **social model of disability** distinguishes between *impairment* (individual characteristic) and *disability* (social/environmental barriers). A trait associated with individual disability may contribute to functioning at the group level; neurotypical-dominant environments create disability through design choices.

**The Double Empathy Problem** (Damian Milton, 2012) fundamentally challenges the “autism = lack of empathy” narrative: when people with very different experiences interact, *both* struggle to empathize.  Research confirms autistic-to-autistic communication is as effective as NT-to-NT; information transfer degrades when crossing the neurotype divide. 

### Tensions and debates

**Who belongs?** The movement firmly includes autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, Tourette’s, intellectual disability.  More contested: schizophrenia, bipolar, BPD, OCD. Robert Chapman suggests identification matters—if someone chooses to resist pathologization and identify as neurodivergent, this should be respected.

**High support needs**: Critics argue the movement has been appropriated by those with lower support needs. ASAN explicitly responds: “We do not label people as ‘high’ or ‘low’ functioning. We recognize the worth and dignity of all people, including people with the most significant impairments.”

**Self-diagnosis debates**: Diagnostic criteria developed on white cisgender male children miss women, people of color, gender-diverse people. Assessment barriers (cost, waiting lists, bias) are substantial. Devon Price supports self-diagnosis; others express concerns about accuracy.

**Superpower critiques**: “Superpower” framing creates pressure to prove exceptional value, implies only those with demonstrable talents deserve acceptance, and enables corporations to claim “inclusion” without addressing accessibility.

# Part II: Etiology and Interrelationships

## 5. Genetic and biological factors

### Heritability and the “missing heritability” problem

|Condition       |Twin-Based Heritability|SNP-Based Heritability|
|-—————|————————|-———————|
|Schizophrenia   |~80%                   |~23-24%               |
|Bipolar disorder|~85%                   |~25%                  |
|Autism          |~80-83%                |~17%                  |
|ADHD            |~74-77%                |—                     |
|BPD             |42-69%                 |—                     |
|Major depression|~37%                   |~8.9%                 |

The gap between twin and SNP estimates represents “missing heritability”—explained by rare variants, non-additive genetic effects, epigenetics, and effect sizes too small to detect.  

### Shared genetic architecture

A landmark 2025 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium analysis (~1 million cases) identified **five genomic factors** explaining ~66% of genetic variance across 14 disorders:

1. **Compulsive factor**: Anorexia, OCD, Tourette’s
1. **Schizophrenia-Bipolar factor**: 70% genetic signal shared
1. **Neurodevelopmental factor**: Autism, ADHD, Tourette’s
1. **Internalizing factor**: Depression, anxiety, PTSD
1. **Substance use factor**: With ADHD cross-loading

**~90% of genetic variants are estimated to be pleiotropic** (affecting multiple traits). This challenges categorical thinking—the biology doesn’t respect DSM boundaries.

### Neurobiological findings and their limitations

**Default Mode Network abnormalities** appear across virtually all major conditions—but direction varies (hyper- vs. hypo-connectivity). Brain structure findings show overlapping patterns across schizophrenia, bipolar, BPD, depression.

**Critical limitations**: Associations between neuroimaging markers and clinical profiles are **small to moderate**. Larger studies show *lower* classification accuracy than small studies. No reliable clinical biomarker has been identified for any psychiatric condition despite decades of research.

### Epigenetics and intergenerational transmission

Trauma affects gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. **Key genes**: NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor), FKBP5, SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter).

Holocaust survivor offspring show altered FKBP5 methylation. However, **psychotherapy produces changes in FKBP5 methylation** in PTSD treatment responders—epigenetic changes are not necessarily permanent.

——

## 6. Comorbidity and overlap

### Why comorbidity rates are so high

**ADHD-Autism**: 50-70% of individuals with ASD also meet ADHD criteria. Until DSM-5, dual diagnosis was prohibited. Both share neurodevelopmental classification and genetic overlap (7 shared loci; 5 differentiating loci with opposite allelic directions).

**BPD-C-PTSD**: Both involve affect dysregulation, negative self-concept, relationship difficulties. Both linked to childhood trauma. ~50% of those with C-PTSD also meet BPD criteria. Some argue BPD is essentially a trauma spectrum disorder.

**Schizophrenia-Bipolar**: 70% genetic signal shared. Both linked to excitatory neuron dysfunction. Similar cortical thinning patterns.

### Artifact or genuine overlap?

**Evidence for genuine overlap**:

- Shared genetic architecture at molecular level
- Common neural substrates (DMN, executive networks)
- Relatives show transdiagnostic risk elevation
- P-factor research suggests general vulnerability

**Evidence for artifactual inflation**:

- Diagnostic boundaries are imprecise
- ~15% misdiagnosis rate between bipolar/schizophrenia
- DSM categories based on symptom patterns, not biology
- Symptoms may be shared while underlying mechanisms differ

*[PLACEHOLDER: Network analysis of symptom overlap across conditions]*

# Part III: Condition-Specific Analysis

## 7. ADHD

### Current understanding

- **Three presentations**: Predominantly Inattentive, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive, Combined 
- **Prevalence**: ~5% children, ~2.5% adults worldwide
- **Neurobiological theory**: Dopamine dysregulation in prefrontal cortex and reward pathways; executive function deficits
- **2024 finding**: Stimulants primarily affect arousal and reward centers, not attention circuits directly—challenging traditional assumptions 

### Critical perspectives

**Overdiagnosis debates**: Stimulant prescriptions nearly doubled 2018-2022. DSM-5 criteria criticized as too broad. Children born in August (youngest in class) significantly more likely diagnosed than September-born—suggesting criteria capture developmental immaturity.

**Adult ADHD validity**: Moffitt et al. (2015) suggested childhood and adult ADHD might be “entirely different syndromes.” Some argue adult ADHD is heterogeneous syndrome, not biologically distinct disease.

**Neurodiversity reframe**: ADHD positioned as cognitive difference—creativity, hyperfocus, entrepreneurial thinking—rather than deficit. Meta-analysis shows ADHD symptoms positively associated with entrepreneurial intentions (though inattention negatively associated with post-launch outcomes).

*[PLACEHOLDER: Gender differences in ADHD presentation; racial disparities in diagnosis]*

——

## 8. Autism Spectrum

### Current understanding

- **DSM-5**: Collapsed separate diagnoses into single Autism Spectrum Disorder; two core domains (social communication/interaction; restricted/repetitive behaviors)
- **Monotropism theory** (Murray, Lawson, Lesser): Autistic attention pulled more strongly toward fewer interests—first autism theory centering subjective autistic experience 
- **Double Empathy Problem**: Communication breakdowns are bidirectional; autistic-autistic communication is effective 

### Critical perspectives

**Masking/camouflaging**: Conscious or unconscious suppression of autistic behaviors to appear neurotypical. Associated with exhaustion, anxiety, depression, identity confusion. Women demonstrate more camouflaging, partly explaining delayed diagnosis.

**ABA controversies**: Substantial proportion of autistic adults report ABA encouraged masking and “behaving normally” with detrimental mental health effects. Criticized for targeting neurotypical compliance rather than autistic wellbeing.

**Functioning labels**: “High-functioning”/“low-functioning” increasingly rejected as conflating autism with intellectual disability and obscuring that all autistic people have both support needs and strengths.

*[PLACEHOLDER: Autistic-led research agenda; participatory research methodologies]*

——

## 9. Bipolar Disorder

### Current understanding

- **Types**: Bipolar I (manic episodes), Bipolar II (hypomanic + depressive), Cyclothymic
- **Genetic component**: ~85% heritability; 70% genetic signal shared with schizophrenia
- **Key distinction**: Involves manic/hypomanic episodes vs. unipolar depression (depressive episodes only)

### Critical perspectives

**Pediatric bipolar controversy**: Significant concerns about diagnosing children and antipsychotic medication use.

**Neurodivergence debates**: The episodic nature differs from developmental conditions. Some argue neurodiversity framework better applies to conditions present from birth. However, the term “neurodivergent” was originally coined to include mood disorders.  **Currently individually determined**—some identify as neurodivergent, others do not.

*[PLACEHOLDER: Cross-cultural variations in bipolar presentation; historical evolution of manic-depressive illness concept]*

——

## 10. Borderline Personality Disorder

### Current understanding

- **Core features**: Emotional/behavioral dysregulation; unstable relationships; identity disturbance; fear of abandonment
- **Trauma prevalence**: 81% report childhood interpersonal trauma
- **Etiology**: Multifactorial—gene-environment interaction; trauma is one of many risk factors
- **Treatability**: High remission rates (50-70% over 5 years); DBT, MBT, TFP, Schema Therapy effective

### Critical perspectives

**Gender bias**: Current research shows **equal prevalence in men and women** despite historical assumption of female predominance. Women’s anger more likely diagnosed as BPD; men’s anger more socially acceptable.

**Stigma**: Pejorative clinical terms (“difficult,” “manipulative”) become self-fulfilling prophecy. Healthcare providers contribute to stigma; clinicians express less warmth and less optimistic recovery expectations.

**Validity debates**: Some argue BPD pathologizes trauma responses better understood as C-PTSD. Feminist critiques note decontextualization of distress from adverse experiences. Counter-argument: “theorizing away” suffering doesn’t help—diagnosis can provide access to treatment.

**Alternative framings**: “Emotional Intensity Disorder” proposed to reduce stigma. C-PTSD overlap substantial but Ford & Courtois (2021) argue they are “distinct syndromes.” 

*[PLACEHOLDER: Dialectical tensions in feminist critiques of BPD; lived experience perspectives]*

——

## 11. Complex PTSD

### Current understanding

- **ICD-11 definition**: PTSD symptoms (re-experiencing, avoidance, threat sense) + Disturbances in Self-Organization (affect dysregulation, negative self-concept, relationship difficulties) 
- **Typically follows**: Prolonged, repeated trauma (childhood abuse, trafficking, captivity)
- **DSM status**: NOT included; instead expanded PTSD criteria and added dissociative subtype 

### Critical perspectives

**BPD relationship**: ~50% with C-PTSD also meet BPD criteria. Key proposed distinction: C-PTSD involves avoidance/disconnection; BPD involves volatile, intense attachment-seeking relationships. 

**ICD-11 vs. DSM divergence**: ICD-11 prioritizes simplicity and clinical utility (especially for global/low-resource settings); DSM approach creates one broad diagnosis with specifiers. 

*[PLACEHOLDER: Developmental Trauma Disorder proposal for childhood C-PTSD; treatment protocol comparisons]*

——

## 12. Narcissistic Personality Disorder

### Current understanding

- **Subtypes**: Grandiose (overt superiority, entitlement, exploitation) vs. Vulnerable (shame, inferiority, hypersensitivity)—dimensions, not discrete categories; individuals fluctuate 
- **Etiology**: Multifactorial—parental overvaluation AND coldness/neglect; temperamental precursors
- **Prevalence**: ~1-6% of population (not the epidemic implied by popular discourse)

### Critical perspectives

**Pop psychology vs. clinical reality**: Media portrayal is one-sidedly negative (“toxic people”). Clinical reality is complex— can be grandiose OR self-loathing, successful OR unable to maintain employment, with underlying shame and fragile self-esteem. 

**Diagnostic limitations**: DSM criteria focus too narrowly on grandiose features, missing vulnerable presentation.  Clinicians readily recognize grandiose narcissism (97.7%); vulnerable presentation often misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, BPD, or C-PTSD. 

**Weaponization**: Term frequently used in interpersonal conflicts. Many labeled “narcissists” by partners/family don’t meet clinical criteria. Important to distinguish narcissistic traits (common) from NPD (relatively rare).

# Part IV: Under-Explored Additions

## 13. Emerging and under-recognized concepts

### Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)

**Definition**: Extreme emotional sensitivity triggered by perceived rejection, criticism, or falling short.

**Status**: NOT in DSM-5/ICD. First peer-reviewed publication 2024 (Dodson et al.). **Community-recognized/emerging**—strong community validation, growing clinical use, very limited formal research.

**Key claims**: ~95% of ADHDers may experience RSD; one-third of adult ADHD patients identify it as most impairing aspect. Treatment responsive to alpha-2 agonists (guanfacine), not CBT/DBT.

*[PLACEHOLDER: Research gaps; relationship to atypical depression rejection sensitivity]*

——

### Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA)

**Definition**: Proposed autism profile characterized by obsessive avoidance of everyday demands coupled with apparent sociability.

**Status**: UK-emerging/contested. Mentioned in National Autism Standards guidance (2012); NOT in DSM/ICD. Currently framed as “profile within autism spectrum.”

**Controversies**: Is it distinct syndrome or behavioral pattern across conditions? Damian Milton and Devon Price argue behavior shouldn’t be considered “pathological.” Gender distribution more balanced than typical autism (~1:1).

*[PLACEHOLDER: Alternative conceptualizations (Pervasive Drive for Autonomy); relationship to demand avoidance in general population]*

——

### Alexithymia

**Definition**: Difficulty recognizing, describing, and distinguishing one’s own emotions.

**Status**: **Established research construct**. Well-validated measures (TAS-20). NOT a standalone diagnosis but increasingly recognized as clinically significant transdiagnostic factor.

**Key finding**: At least **50% of autistic individuals** experience alexithymia. Critical research suggests “alexithymia, not autism, is associated with impaired interoception”—many socio-emotional features attributed to autism may be alexithymia-driven.

*[PLACEHOLDER: Alexithymia across conditions; treatment approaches; relationship to interoception interventions]*

——

### Sensory Processing Differences

**Status**: **Contested**. NOT in DSM-5/ICD as standalone; recognized as possible ASD criterion only. Strong occupational therapy support; UCSF neuroimaging studies support distinct SPD.

**Key finding**: UCSF research shows SPD has neurobiological basis distinct from autism—shared white matter disruption in sensory pathways BUT divergent connectivity in social/emotional pathways.

**Prevalence across conditions**: Autism (up to 90%); ADHD (46-69% sensory over-responsivity); trauma (well-documented).

*[PLACEHOLDER: Sensory integration therapy evidence review; polyvagal theory connections and critiques]*

——

### Dissociative Disorders

**Status**: **DSM-5 recognized** (DID, DPDR, Dissociative Amnesia) but **controversial** regarding specific mechanisms.

**Structural Dissociation Model** (Van der Hart et al.): Personality not born integrated; trauma disrupts integration. Primary (1 ANP + 1 EP = simple PTSD), Secondary (1 ANP + multiple EP = C-PTSD/BPD), Tertiary (multiple ANP + EP = DID).

**Neuroimaging support**: Distinct neural activation patterns between personality parts; actors cannot replicate brain patterns of DID even when trained.

*[PLACEHOLDER: False memory debates; iatrogenic concerns; neurodiversity perspective possibilities]*

——

### OCD Spectrum

**Status**: **DSM-5 established** (OCD and Related Disorders chapter).

**Autism relationship**: Up to 17% of autistic individuals may have OCD. Denmark study: autistic people 2x more likely to develop OCD; people with OCD 4x more likely to receive later autism diagnosis. **47% of OCD patients** scored above clinical autism threshold.

**Key distinction**: OCD compulsions are **ego-dystonic** (intrusive, unwanted); autistic restricted/repetitive behaviors often **ego-syntonic** (enjoyable, regulating).

*[PLACEHOLDER: OCD as potential neurodivergence; misdiagnosis patterns]*

——

### Schizophrenia Spectrum

**Status**: **DSM-5 established** but **actively contested** by critical psychiatry and survivor movements.

**Hearing Voices Movement**: International movement shifting from “symptoms of illness” to “meaningful phenomena.” 170+ groups in England alone.

**Mad Pride**: Rejects illness/disorder language; reclaims “mad” with positive connotations; views madness as grounds for identity and culture.

**Neurodiversity application**: Emerging but controversial. Robert Chapman argues for “affirmative embrace” of schizophrenia as identity. Challenge: many symptoms experienced as genuinely distressing.

*[PLACEHOLDER: Cross-cultural voice-hearing research; Open Dialogue approach; long-term medication outcome debates]*

——

### Learning Differences

**Status**: **DSM-5 established** (Specific Learning Disorders) with **strong neurodiversity reframing**.

**Conditions**: Dyslexia (reading), dyscalculia (math), dysgraphia (writing), dyspraxia/DCD (motor coordination).

**Overlap**: Research shows “rare for person to have only one area of difficulty.” 53% of dyslexic children also have dyspraxia; 60% co-occurrence between DCD and dyslexia.

**Strengths-based**: Dyslexia associated with problem-solving, innovative thinking; dyscalculia with creative thinking; dyspraxia with strategic thinking and empathy.

*[PLACEHOLDER: Educational accommodations research; technological interventions; workplace considerations]*

——

## 14. Emerging theoretical frameworks

### Monotropism

**Definition**: Autistic attention style—attention “pulled more strongly toward a smaller number of interests at any given time.” 

**Status**: **Emerging autistic-led research**. Growing empirical support, autistic community endorsed, not yet mainstream clinical adoption.

**Significance**: First autism theory to center subjective autistic experience.  Provides unified explanation for diagnostic criteria without deficit framing.  May unify understanding of ADHD and autism (Fergus Murray, 2023).

——

### Interoception Research

**Definition**: Perception of internal body states (hunger, thirst, emotions, heart rate, pain).

**Status**: **Rapidly emerging research area**. Strong scientific interest; clinical applications developing (Kelly Mahler’s curriculum).

**Connections**: Alexithymia strongly linked to interoceptive difficulties. Monotropism can lead to missed interoceptive signals during flow states. Foundational for emotional awareness and regulation.

——

### Polyvagal Theory

**Definition**: Three autonomic circuits (ventral vagal/social engagement, sympathetic/mobilization, dorsal vagal/shutdown); subconscious “neuroception” of safety/threat.

**Status**: **Clinically popular but scientifically contested**. Widely used therapeutically; empirical support mixed.

**Neurodiversity critique**: Should not be used to make neurodivergent people “show up in neurotypical ways.” Claim that autism = broken social engagement system criticized as “simply another way to pathologize autistic people.” Trauma, not inherent neurotype, may explain autonomic differences.

——

# Part V: Key Unresolved Questions

## For deeper exploration

### Ontological questions

- [ ] Can psychiatric categories ever be “natural kinds,” or is this category error?
- [ ] What does the p-factor actually represent? (Neuroticism? Impaired regulation? General liability?)
- [ ] Does the disorder/difference distinction map onto anything real, or is it value-laden throughout?

### Diagnostic framework questions

- [ ] Will dimensional models (HiTOP) replace categorical (DSM) in clinical practice?
- [ ] How can diagnostic systems serve access to services without pathologizing?
- [ ] What would decolonized diagnostic frameworks look like?

### Etiology questions

- [ ] Why haven’t decades of biological research yielded clinical biomarkers?
- [ ] To what extent is intergenerational epigenetic transmission genuine vs. environmental transmission?
- [ ] How should social determinants be weighted against biological factors?

### Neurodiversity questions

- [ ] Can neurodiversity meaningfully include conditions characterized primarily by distress?
- [ ] How to balance de-pathologization with access to supports that require diagnosis?
- [ ] What is the relationship between neurodiversity and high support needs populations?

### Condition-specific questions

- [ ] Is BPD better conceptualized as trauma spectrum disorder or distinct entity?
- [ ] What explains the ADHD-autism overlap—shared etiology or categorization artifact?
- [ ] Should bipolar disorder be included in neurodiversity frameworks?
