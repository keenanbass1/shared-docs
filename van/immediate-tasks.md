# IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

## Van Measurements & Specs
- [ ] Measure interior length
- [ ] Measure interior width
- [ ] Measure interior height
- [ ] Check payload capacity
- [ ] Confirm total solar panel wattage

## Electrical System (Can do now)
- [ ] Add additional fuses to system
- [ ] Install 0 AWG lugs
- [ ] Photo document 12V system for reference

## Phase 2: Planning (Before cutting/drilling)
- [ ] Plan 12V wiring runs (lighting circuits, switches, accessory locations)
- [ ] Plan where switches will go
- [ ] Plan where USB outlets/accessories will be located

## Phase 1: Roof Work (Needs research first)
- [ ] Research MaxxAir installation on mid-roof Transit
- [ ] Research if roof cutting happens before or after panelling
- [ ] MaxxAir fan installation (after research)

## Phase 2: Wiring Installation
- [ ] Run wiring for ceiling lights, reading lights, work area lights
- [ ] Run wiring for any 12V accessories (USB outlets, etc)
- [ ] Install 12V LED lighting system

## Phase 2: Walls & Insulation
- [ ] Additional insulation layer (foil board) if needed
- [ ] Wall panelling installation (roof & walls)

Notes:
- Start with measurements and electrical prep work (no blockers)
- Do research tasks in parallel while doing Phase 2 planning
- Phase 2 wiring must be done before panelling goes up
