### Zone Breakdown

**Bed Zone (Rear ~1400mm)**
- Horizontal bed at full width
- Under-bed "garage" storage (2 large sliding drawers already installed)
- Flat storage shelf above bed head area

**Living Zone (Middle ~1800mm)**
- Driver side: Extend existing L-cabinet forward for pantry/dry storage
- Passenger side: Galley kitchen by sliding door (sink, fridge, cooktop)
- Centre: Lagun table deployment zone, seating
- Overhead: Cabinets both sides (250-300mm deep, using 1470mm ceiling width)

**Cab Zone (Front)**
- Overhead cab storage shelf (custom build required for 2008 model)
- Existing L-shaped cabinet behind seats with 12V system

### Overhead Cabinet Dimensions
- Ceiling width above windows: 1470mm
- Recommended cabinet depth: 250-300mm each side
- Clear aisle remaining: ~870-970mm
- Construction: 11mm ply frames, 3mm ply doors/skin
- Mount to existing M6 rivnuts
- Use gas struts or soft-close hinges (prevent doors flying open while driving)
- Add lip on opening edge to prevent contents spilling

### Overhead Cab Storage (Above Driver/Passenger)
**Challenge**: 2008 Transit has different headliner than newer models. DIY kits (Vancillary, Timber Van Kits) designed for 2015+ US Transit.

**Approach for 2008**:
- Remove existing plastic headliner/console
- Measure actual mounting points
- Custom build plywood shelf to fit
- Mount supports through metal with L-braces
- Consider vertical strut wall behind seats (crash safety)

**Alternative**: Soft mesh/fabric hammock storage (lighter, no complex mounting)

### Fridge Placement Options
1. Under existing L-cabinet counter (needs flip-up section - top-opening Dometic)
2. By sliding door (accessible inside/outside)
3. Near bed foot (convenient night access)

**Note**: Top-opening Dometic needs clearance above - don't bury it under fixed counter.

### Sliding Door Side Ideas
**Option A - Galley Kitchen** (Recommended)
- Sink + cooktop facing sliding door = ventilation + views while cooking
- Natural separation: dry storage driver side, wet/cooking passenger side
- Fridge could go here in pull-out drawer style

**Option B - Multi-Purpose Bench**
- Bench seat with storage underneath
- Upper section as pull-out pantry
- Doubles as seating when Lagun table deployed

### Storage Hacks to Implement
| Hack | Location | Est. Cost |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Magnetic knife strip | Kitchen wall | ~$15 |
| Collapsible Tupperware | Kitchen storage | ~$30 |
| Vacuum bags for bedding | Under bed drawers | ~$20 |
| Pegboard panel | Inside cabinet door | 3mm ply (have) |
| Sink cover = cutting board | Kitchen counter | Custom cut ply |
| Door-mounted organizers | Inside cabinet doors | ~$10-20 each |
| Tension rods under cabinets | Hang mugs, utensils | ~$5 each |

### Rear Door Storage (External)

**Concept**: Mount toolbox-style storage boxes to barn doors instead of/in addition to roof storage.

**Benefits**:
- No aerodynamic drag (vs roof boxes)
- Frees roof for platform/deck use
- Easy access to outdoor gear (chairs, BBQ, mud mats)
- Keeps dirty outdoor items outside

**Weight Limits**:
- **Max ~100-150lbs (45-70kg) per door** - hinges, latches, and door skin are the limiting factors
- Aluminess rates their racks at 100lbs dynamic capacity

**Commercial Options**:
- **Aluminess** rear door racks (~$800-1500 USD) - bolt to factory door locations, no drilling
- **Flatline Van Co** storage box - welded aluminum, weatherproof, gas struts
- Standard ute/truck toolboxes (diamond plate aluminum) - need custom mounting

**DIY Approach**:
- Mount directly to door hinges (strongest option) with backing plates
- Use heavy steel angle brackets
- Have aluminum box custom made by HVAC company (cheaper than Aluminess)
- Keep depth under ~350mm (13-14") to avoid door balance issues

**Considerations for Your Van**:
- Barn doors must still close properly with weight added
- May need upgraded door struts/gas stays
- Check hinge condition before adding weight
- Consider spare tire carrier on one door + storage box on other

**Alternative - Soft Storage**:
- VanDerMoon Moon Organizer - fabric pockets/nets, up to 40kg total
- Lower weight, easier install, good for lighter items

## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Is 25A AC charger enough for our system?
**A: YES - Perfect for your setup!**
- 2x200Ah LiFePO4 = 400Ah total
- 25A charges 50% to 100% in ~8 hours
- You have solar + DC-DC as primary, AC as backup/supplement
- Victron Blue Smart 25A is excellent quality (~$350-450 new)
- **Marketplace deal: Grab it if under $300**

### Q: How do we secure drawers/furniture to floor?
**A: Use L-Brackets + Rubber Mat**
- Mount 2-4 heavy duty L-brackets (50-75mm) at back/side corners
- Screw through floor into furniture frame
- Add rubber mat underneath to dampen vibration
- Parts: Bunnings L-brackets $3-5 each
- **Rule**: Anything >5kg must be secured

### Q: Should we get smart lights?
**A: NO - Use dimmers instead**
- Smart lights need WiFi/hub (battery drain, complexity)
- **Better**: 12V LED lights with dimmer switches
- Dimmer switches: Jaycar $15-25 each
- Zero idle power, simple, reliable
- Optional: RGB LED strips with RF remote for ambient (~$40)

### Q: How do I plan 12V wiring for lights/accessories?
**A: Follow this process:**
1. Create zone map (ceiling, kitchen, bedside, desk, etc.)
2. Count components per zone, calculate total watts/amps
3. Plan wire runs from fuse panel to each zone (14 AWG wire)
4. Choose switch locations
5. Calculate wire lengths (add 20% extra)
6. Run wires BEFORE wall panels go up
7. Wire lights in parallel, use appropriate fuses
8. Test each circuit before finalizing

**See build-guide.md for detailed step-by-step wiring instructions**

### Q: Should we add a sound system?
**A: Start simple, upgrade later**
- **Start with**: Good Bluetooth speaker ($100-150)
- If you use it daily after 3 months: Install ceiling speakers
- Full speaker install: ~$250-300 (4 speakers + Bluetooth receiver + amp)
- Power draw: 3-7A at moderate volume (add to 12V planning)

**See build-guide.md for speaker installation instructions**
