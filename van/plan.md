## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Is 25A AC charger enough for our system?
**A: YES - Perfect for your setup!**
- 2x200Ah LiFePO4 = 400Ah total
- 25A charges 50% to 100% in ~8 hours
- You have solar + DC-DC as primary, AC as backup/supplement
- Victron Blue Smart 25A is excellent quality (~$350-450 new)
- **Marketplace deal: Grab it if under $300**

### Q: How do we secure drawers/furniture to floor?
**A: Use L-Brackets + Rubber Mat**
- Mount 2-4 heavy duty L-brackets (50-75mm) at back/side corners
- Screw through floor into furniture frame
- Add rubber mat underneath to dampen vibration
- Parts: Bunnings L-brackets $3-5 each
- **Rule**: Anything >5kg must be secured

### Q: Should we get smart lights?
**A: NO - Use dimmers instead**
- Smart lights need WiFi/hub (battery drain, complexity)
- **Better**: 12V LED lights with dimmer switches
- Dimmer switches: Jaycar $15-25 each
- Zero idle power, simple, reliable
- Optional: RGB LED strips with RF remote for ambient (~$40)

### Q: How do I plan 12V wiring for lights/accessories?
**A: Follow this process:**
1. Create zone map (ceiling, kitchen, bedside, desk, etc.)
2. Count components per zone, calculate total watts/amps
3. Plan wire runs from fuse panel to each zone (14 AWG wire)
4. Choose switch locations
5. Calculate wire lengths (add 20% extra)
6. Run wires BEFORE wall panels go up
7. Wire lights in parallel, use appropriate fuses
8. Test each circuit before finalizing

**See build-guide.md for detailed step-by-step wiring instructions**

### Q: Should we add a sound system?
**A: Start simple, upgrade later**
- **Start with**: Good Bluetooth speaker ($100-150)
- If you use it daily after 3 months: Install ceiling speakers
- Full speaker install: ~$250-300 (4 speakers + Bluetooth receiver + amp)
- Power draw: 3-7A at moderate volume (add to 12V planning)

**See build-guide.md for speaker installation instructions**
