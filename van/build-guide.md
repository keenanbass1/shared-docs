## 1. 12V LED Lighting Installation

### Standard Approach
- Wire lights in **parallel** (not series)
- Use appropriately sized **fuse box** for all circuits
- Wire gauge: **14 AWG** for circuits up to 100W
- Every light circuit needs a **fuse** at the power source

### Fuse Sizing Formula
1. Calculate total Watts for all lights on one circuit
2. Divide Watts by 12V = Amps
3. Add 25% safety margin
4. Round up to next fuse size

### Components Needed
- 12V LED lights (downlights, strip lights, task lights)
- SPST switches (Single Pole Single Throw) or dimmer switches
- Fuse box/panel (e.g., Blue Sea Systems 12-circuit)
- 14 AWG wire (red for positive, black for negative)
- Inline fuse holders or blade fuse panel
- Heat shrink tubing
- Crimp connectors

## 2A. Sink Installation

### Sink Type Selection

**Drop-In Sinks (RECOMMENDED FOR DIY)**
- Sits on top of counter with rim visible
- Easiest installation - beginner friendly
- Most common in van builds
- Rim creates seal against counter
- Wide variety of sizes available
- Cost: $30-100

**Undermount Sinks**
- Mounted below counter surface
- Sleek look, maximizes counter space
- Requires precise countertop cutout
- More complex installation
- Premium aesthetic
- Cost: $50-150

**Recommendation:** Drop-in sink for DIY build - much more forgiving installation

### Materials & Sizes for Van Life

**Material Options:**
- **Stainless steel** - most popular, durable, lightweight (~$40-80)
- **Plastic/composite** - cheapest, lighter (~$20-40)
- **Enamel coated** - classic look, heavier (~$50-100)

**Size Considerations:**
- **Small**: 250x300mm - tight spaces, minimal washing
- **Medium**: 350x400mm - good balance for vans
- **Large**: 450x500mm - full-size washing, takes more counter space

**Recommendation:** Medium stainless steel drop-in (350x400mm) - best compromise

### Step-by-Step: Drop-In Sink Installation

#### 1. Planning & Measuring

**Counter Location:**
- Near fridge for food prep efficiency
- Access to water supply and drain
- Structural support underneath (build frame if needed)
- Avoid placing over wheel wells if possible

**Measure Sink:**
- Get exact dimensions of sink rim
- Check depth - ensure clearance below counter
- Typical depth: 100-150mm
- Account for faucet placement

#### 2. Cutting Counter Opening

**Mark Template:**
- Most sinks come with paper template
- OR trace sink upside down on counter
- Measure inset required (typically 10-20mm from rim edge)
- Mark cutout line smaller than rim so sink sits on surface

**Cutting Process:**
1. Drill starter hole (10mm bit) just inside cutout line at corner
2. Insert jigsaw blade into hole
3. Cut along marked line slowly
4. Support cutout piece so it doesn't fall and splinter edge
5. Test fit sink - should sit on counter surface with rim overlapping

**Clean Up:**
- Sand edges smooth
- Remove sawdust
- Wipe clean with damp cloth

#### 3. Sealing & Installation

**Protect Counter Edge:**
- Apply thin bead of clear silicone caulk around inside edge of hole
- This seals wood/ply from moisture that gets under sink rim
- Let dry 10 minutes

**Install Sink:**
1. Run bead of silicone around underside of sink rim
2. Or use plumber's putty (less permanent, easier removal)
3. Lower sink into hole
4. Press down firmly - should squish sealant slightly
5. Wipe away excess sealant with damp cloth immediately

**Secure Sink (if using clips):**
- Some sinks have mounting clips underneath
- Slide clips into sink rail
- Position clip brackets
- Tighten screws to pull sink tight against counter
- If no clips, silicone alone often sufficient in vans

#### 4. Installing Faucet/Tap

**Before Sink Installation (Easier):**
- Install faucet to sink BEFORE placing sink in counter
- Pass faucet supply lines through sink holes
- Tighten faucet mounting nut from underneath

**Faucet Types for Vans:**
- **Single hole** - simplest, most common
- **Widespread** - separate hot/cold handles (need 2 holes)
- **Wall mount** - mounted to wall behind sink (no counter holes)
- **Gooseneck** - high arc for washing large items

**Installation:**
1. Pass faucet tailpiece through sink hole
2. Place rubber gasket underneath sink
3. Thread mounting nut onto tailpiece
4. Tighten with basin wrench or pliers
5. Don't overtighten - can crack sink

#### 5. Plumbing Connections

**Supply Line (From Water Tank):**
- Use flexible 12mm (1/2") tubing - PEX recommended
- Connect from water pump to faucet supply line
- Use compression fittings (easier than soldering)
- Apply teflon tape to threaded connections
- Keep supply line secured with clips (prevents rattling)

**Drain Line (To Grey Water Tank):**
- Install sink strainer in drain hole
- Apply plumber's putty under strainer rim
- Tighten strainer locknut from underneath
- Attach flexible drain hose (32-40mm / 1.25-1.5")
- Run to grey water tank
- Secure with hose clamps at connections
- Slope hose downward for drainage (no low spots where water collects)

**PEX Plumbing Advantages:**
- Lightweight
- Easy to cut with PEX cutter
- Flexible - routes around obstacles
- Compression fittings don't require tools
- Less likely to burst if freezes
- Available at Bunnings

#### 6. Testing for Leaks

**Before Permanent Installation:**
1. Connect water supply and drain temporarily
2. Turn on water pump
3. Fill sink with water
4. Check all connections for leaks
5. Let sit 10 minutes, check underneath
6. Open drain, check grey water line for leaks
7. Fix any leaks before sealing permanently

**Common Leak Points:**
- Faucet base (gasket not seated properly)
- Supply line connections (need teflon tape)
- Drain strainer (need more plumber's putty)
- Drain hose connections (tighten hose clamps)

### Countertop Material Considerations

**12mm Plywood with Finish:**
- Most common DIY option
- Seal all edges with marine varnish or epoxy
- Multiple coats around sink cutout (moisture protection)
- Consider tiling around sink for waterproofing

**Laminate/Formica:**
- Apply laminate before cutting sink hole
- Use laminate-safe caulk (regular silicone can discolor)
- Professional look

**Butcher Block:**
- Solid wood counters
- Must seal thoroughly with food-safe sealer
- Sand and re-seal yearly
- Beautiful but high maintenance

**Stainless Steel:**
- Professional kitchen look
- Completely waterproof
- Can be expensive
- Harder to DIY cut

### Sink Access Panel

**Important:** Build access panel in cabinet below sink for:
- Plumbing repairs
- Tightening connections
- Accessing pump or filter
- Removable panel with screws (not glued)

### Material Options

**3mm Plywood** (Most common for walls)
- Flexible, works with curves
- Lightweight
- Cheap (~$30-50/sheet at Bunnings)
- Project panels: 1220 x 2440 x 3mm

**6mm Plywood** (For flat areas/ceilings)
- More rigid
- Better finish
- Slightly heavier

**Vinyl Covering** (Over plywood)
- Moisture resistant
- Easy to clean
- Durable (scratches, UV, spills)
- Various colors/patterns
- Apply with contact adhesive

### Installation Process
1. Create cardboard templates for each panel
2. Trace onto plywood
3. Cut with jigsaw or circular saw
4. Sand edges smooth
5. Pre-drill holes for screws
6. Attach to van ribs with self-tapping screws (3/4" or 12-14mm)
7. Optional: vinyl wrap for finished look

### Furring Strips (Wooden Ribs) - RECOMMENDED

**Why Use Furring Strips?**
- Creates level surface (van ribs are uneven)
- More room for insulation behind panels
- Easier to attach panels (screwing into wood vs metal)
- Reduces screws into van metal (fewer leak points)
- Can run wiring behind strips
- Better finish quality

**Wood Options for Furring Strips:**

*For Curved Areas (walls):*
- **1/2" Baltic birch plywood** strips (4" wide) - BEST, can bend with curves
- 1/4" or 3/8" Baltic birch - thinner, very flexible
- Cut lengthwise down van (vertical orientation)

*For Flat Areas (ceiling):*
- **1x2 pine** (19mm x 38mm actual) - straight sections
- **1x3 pine** (19mm x 64mm actual) - ceiling where more support needed
- 3/4" plywood strips (3-4" wide) - stronger option

**Spacing:**
- Install furring strip on **every van rib** (typically 40-60cm apart)
- OR every 2 feet (60cm) minimum
- Ceiling: use all horizontal ribs for maximum support

### Installing Furring Strips with Rivnuts

**Since you have rivnuts already installed:**

1. **Countersink the furring strips**
   - Use countersink bit or Forstner bit
   - Create shallow recess on back of wood so bolt head sits flush
   - Allows wood to sit flat against metal rib
   - Depth: just enough for bolt head + washer

2. **Measure and cut furring strips**
   - Measure length of each rib section
   - Cut strips to length
   - Sand edges smooth

3. **Pre-drill holes in furring strips**
   - Mark where rivnuts are located on ribs
   - Drill clearance holes in wood (slightly larger than bolt diameter)
   - If rivnuts are M6: drill 7mm holes in wood
   - If rivnuts are M8: drill 9mm holes in wood

4. **Attach to rivnuts**
   - Use M6 or M8 bolts (whatever size your rivnuts are)
   - Use washers under bolt heads
   - Don't overtighten (can strip rivnuts)
   - Typical bolt length: 20-30mm depending on wood thickness

5. **Check for level**
   - Use long straightedge across multiple strips
   - Shim if needed (thin plywood scraps)
   - Important for final panel fit

**Rivnut Sizes Commonly Used:**
- M6 (6mm) - most common
- M8 (8mm) - for heavier loads
- 10-24 thread (imperial, less common)

### Attaching Panels to Furring Strips

Once furring strips installed:
- Use **wood screws** (25-40mm long depending on ply thickness)
- Or use **lath screws** (1 1/4" / 30mm)
- Screw every 30cm (1 foot) along each strip
- Top, middle, and bottom of each panel
- Optional: construction adhesive + screws for maximum strength (marine grade)

### Alternative: Direct to Ribs (No Furring)
- **Faster but less recommended**
- Self-tapping sheet metal screws through ply into van ribs
- 3/4" (12-14mm) screws with pan head
- Panels will follow curves of ribs (less flat finish)
- More holes in van metal
- Harder to hide wiring

## 5. Overhead Cabinets & Storage Building

### Construction Method: Stick-Built Frame with Plywood (RECOMMENDED)

**Why Stick-Built:**
- 70% lighter than solid ply boxes
- Professional result
- Uses less material
- Strong enough for overhead use
- Flexible design

### Using 11mm Plywood for Frame (PERFECT FOR YOUR BUILD)

**Your Materials:**
- 11mm ply sheets → cut into frame pieces
- 3mm ply sheets → skin/panels
- M6 dome head bolts + rivnuts

**Advantages of 11mm Ply vs Pine:**
- ✅ Lighter than pine 2x2
- ✅ More stable (no warping/twisting)
- ✅ Stronger for the weight
- ✅ You already have it!

### Step-by-Step: Stick-Built Cabinet Construction

#### 1. Design & Planning

**Measure Your Space:**
- Mark where cabinets will go on ceiling/walls
- Account for head clearance (minimum 1850mm from floor to cabinet bottom)
- Consider MaxxAir fan location (don't block)
- Measure depth available (typically 250-350mm deep for overhead)

**Sketch Cabinet Layout:**
- Where doors open (hinged, sliding, lift-up?)
- Internal dividers/shelves
- What will be stored (height/depth requirements)

**Frame Dimensions:**
- Cut 11mm ply into **50-75mm wide strips** for frame members
- Narrower (50mm) = lighter
- Wider (75mm) = stronger, easier to attach skin

#### 2. Cutting Frame Components

**From 11mm Ply:**
- **Top & bottom rectangles**: Outer frame that mounts to van
- **Vertical corners**: Connect top and bottom frames
- **Internal dividers**: Support for shelves/compartments
- **Door frames**: If doing lift-up or hinged doors

**Cut List Example (for 600mm long x 300mm wide x 200mm deep cabinet):**
- 2x 600mm lengths (front/back of top frame) - 50mm wide
- 2x 300mm lengths (sides of top frame) - 50mm wide
- 2x 600mm lengths (front/back of bottom frame) - 50mm wide
- 2x 300mm lengths (sides of bottom frame) - 50mm wide
- 4x 200mm lengths (vertical corners) - 50mm wide
- Internal supports as needed

**Cutting Tips:**
- Use circular saw or jigsaw with guide
- Cut on GOOD side up (prevents tear-out)
- Label pieces as you cut

#### 3. Assembly Method

**Joining Techniques:**

**Option A: Butt Joints + Glue + Screws (SIMPLEST)**
- Apply timber glue to joints
- Pre-drill pilot holes (3mm bit for wood screws)
- Use 25mm wood screws to join
- Wipe excess glue immediately

**Option B: Pocket Holes (STRONGER)**
- Use Kreg Jig or similar
- Creates angled holes for hidden screws
- Stronger joint, cleaner look
- Requires pocket hole jig (~$50-100 Bunnings)

**Assembly Sequence:**
1. Build top frame rectangle (glue + screw corners)
2. Build bottom frame rectangle
3. Attach 4 vertical corner pieces to top frame
4. Attach bottom frame to verticals
5. Add internal dividers/supports
6. Check square with measuring tape (diagonals should be equal)
7. Let glue dry 30 minutes before skinning

#### 4. Skinning with 3mm Ply

**Cutting 3mm Panels:**
- Measure each face of cabinet frame
- Add 5-10mm extra, trim later for perfect fit
- Cut with jigsaw or sharp utility knife + straight edge

**Attaching Skin:**
- Apply thin bead of timber glue to frame edges
- Position 3mm panel
- Use 15mm brad nails or panel pins every 75-100mm
- Or use wood screws (pre-drill 2mm pilot holes to prevent splitting)
- **Important**: Skin ALL sides for rigidity (top, bottom, back, sides)
- Leave front open if doing doors, or skin with door later

**Skin Order:**
1. Back panel first
2. Top panel
3. Bottom panel
4. Side panels
5. Front (if no door) or door panel separate

#### 5. Mounting to Van

**Using Your Rivnuts + M6 Dome Head Bolts:**

**Preparation:**
1. Identify van ribs or furring strips to mount to
2. Mark cabinet mounting locations
3. On cabinet frame, drill 7mm clearance holes for M6 bolts
4. **CRITICAL**: Countersink these holes on outside of cabinet
   - Use Forstner bit (12-15mm diameter) on drill
   - Drill shallow recess (~3-5mm deep) just enough for dome head to sit flush
   - Test fit bolt to ensure it doesn't protrude

**Mounting Process:**
1. Hold cabinet in position (get helper)
2. Mark mounting bolt positions through cabinet onto van ceiling
3. Install rivnuts in van ceiling if not already there
4. Apply sealant/sikaflex to back edge of cabinet (prevents moisture)
5. Position cabinet
6. Install M6 bolts with washers through cabinet into rivnuts
7. Tighten evenly (don't overtighten - can strip rivnuts)
8. Use 4-6 mounting points minimum for each cabinet

**Mounting to Furring Strips (if installed):**
- Easier than direct to metal
- Screw from inside cabinet through top frame into furring
- Use 40mm wood screws
- 4-6 screws per cabinet distributed evenly

#### 6. Doors & Hardware

**Door Options:**

**A. Lift-Up Doors (POPULAR)**
- Hinged at top
- Opens upward
- Use gas struts to hold open
- Best for overhead cabinets

**Gas Strut Installation:**
- 2x gas struts per door
- Mount one end to cabinet frame, one to door
- Test before final installation (can adjust force)
- Buy at Bunnings: "Cabinet lift support" ~$20-40/pair

**B. Hinged Doors (Traditional)**
- Piano hinge along one edge
- Magnetic catch to keep closed
- Can swing left or right

**C. Sliding Doors**
- Use sliding door track
- Overlapping panels
- Good for tight spaces

**D. No Doors (Open Shelving)**
- Simplest option
- Use straps or bungee to secure items
- Fastest access

**Door Construction:**
- Frame from 11mm ply strips (perimeter rectangle)
- Skin with 3mm ply
- Add handle or routed finger pull
- Weight: Keep light for lift-up doors

#### 7. Internal Organization

**Shelves:**
- Cut from 11mm ply
- Support with 11mm ply cleats screwed to sides
- Space 150-250mm apart depending on storage needs

**Dividers:**
- 11mm ply vertical dividers
- Create compartments
- Prevents items sliding around

**Soft Lining (Optional):**
- Stick-on felt or thin foam
- Reduces rattles
- Protects items

### Lower Cabinets & Storage

**Same Construction Method:**
- Stick-built frame with 11mm ply
- Skin with 3mm ply
- Mount to floor and/or walls

**Additional Considerations for Lower Cabinets:**
- Can be heavier duty (not overhead weight concern)
- Can use 12mm ply for high-wear surfaces (countertops)
- Add feet or mount directly to floor
- Consider drawer slides if building drawers

### Under-Bed Storage

**Option A: Drawers**
- Build drawer boxes with 11mm frame + 3mm skin
- Mount heavy-duty drawer slides to bed frame
- Access from side or back of van

**Option B: Lift-Up Bed with Gas Struts**
- Mount gas struts to bed frame and floor/wall
- Entire bed lifts like trunk
- Huge storage underneath
- Use IKEA slats that lift with frame

**Option C: Rolling Bins/Crates**
- Simplest option
- Plastic bins or custom wood boxes on wheels
- Roll out from under bed
- No installation required

### Flat Storage Above Bed (Head Area)

**For Small Flat Items:**
- Build shallow tray (50-100mm deep)
- 11mm ply frame + 3mm bottom

## 6. Shore Power Inlet (240V)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING
**In Australia, all 240V electrical work in caravans/campervans MUST be completed by a licensed electrician to comply with AS/NZS 3001.2:2022.** This is a legal requirement in all states and territories. Improper AC wiring can be fatal. This guide is for understanding the system, not DIY installation.

### Australian Standards & Legal Requirements

**Relevant Standards:**
- **AS/NZS 3001.2:2022** - Electrical installations for vehicles and relocatable units (caravan industry standard)
- **AS/NZS 3000:2018** - Australian Wiring Rules (mandated by legislation in every state)
- Clause 7.8.2.3 of AS3000:2018 requires 230V transportable installations comply with AS3001.2

**Key Requirements:**
- Must use **15A inlet** (wider earth pin than domestic 10A)
- All components must be **double-pole** (switches both active AND neutral)
- RCD (Residual Current Device / safety switch) is MANDATORY
- **16A double-pole combined circuit breaker/RCD device** required
- Cable must be minimum **2.5mm² twin & earth**
- Extension lead must be 15A rated, maximum 10m length, continuous (no joins)

### System Components Overview

**Complete 240V System Includes:**
1. **External inlet socket** (15A, weatherproof IP55+)
2. **Small distribution board** containing:
   - 16A double-pole RCD/circuit breaker combo
   - Connection terminals
3. **Wiring** (2.5mm² twin & earth throughout)
4. **Double-pole power outlets** (240V sockets inside van)
5. **Earth connections** (chassis + appliances)
6. Optional: **Outdoor power outlet** (weatherproof)

### Wiring Configuration (For Electrician Reference)

**Earth Wire System (Critical):**
- **Primary earth**: Green/yellow wire from inlet → chassis (minimum 2.5mm²)
  - Must connect with bolt, nut, AND spring washer to bare metal
  - Clean connection point (remove paint/rust)
- **Secondary earth**: From chassis → all power outlets and appliances
- All appliances with earth connectors must be earthed

**Active & Neutral Wiring:**
- **Active** (brown or red) from inlet → double-pole RCD/breaker → outlets
- **Neutral** (blue or black) from inlet → double-pole RCD/breaker → outlets
- Both active AND neutral must switch at breaker (double-pole requirement)

**Circuit Breaker Sizing:**
- 16A is correct for 2.5mm² wiring
- Breaker protects the **wiring**, not the appliances
- 2.5mm² cable can handle >16A, but 16A breaker prevents overheating

### Installation Process (Licensed Electrician)

**1. Plan Location**
- Inlet location: Exterior, accessible, protected from direct spray
- Near where internal distribution board will mount
- Consider extension lead routing when at campsites

**2. Install Inlet Socket**
- Drill hole per manufacturer specifications
- Use gasket or liberal Sikaflex sealant
- Mount with stainless steel screws
- Ensure weatherproof seal around edges
- Test fit weatherproof cover/flap

**3. Install Distribution Board**
- Mount inside van near inlet point
- Small weatherproof enclosure
- Contains 16A double-pole RCD/breaker combo
- Secure to wall/cabinet securely

**4. Run Earth Connection First**
- 2.5mm² green/yellow from inlet to clean chassis point
- Use spring washer, bolt, nut
- Clean bare metal connection (remove paint)
- Second earth wire from chassis to distribution board

**5. Run Active & Neutral**
- 2.5mm² twin & earth from inlet to distribution board
- Through RCD/circuit breaker (double-pole)
- From breaker to all power outlets
- Keep AC wiring **minimum 50cm away from DC wiring**
- NEVER run AC and DC in same conduit
- Use cable clips every 30cm

**6. Install Power Outlets**
- Must be **double-pole** outlets (caravan-specific)
- Both active and neutral switch
- Connect earth to each outlet
- Use weatherproof outdoor outlet if needed

**7. Testing (Electrician Only)**
- Test RCD function (test button)
- Test polarity at all outlets
- Test earth continuity
- Verify no leakage current
- Issue certificate of compliance

### Connection at Caravan Parks
- Caravan parks legally must have RCD protection on supply
- Your van must also have RCD (double protection)
- 15A extension lead required (identified by wider earth pin)
- Maximum 10m lead length
- Lead must be continuous (no joins/extensions)

### Important Notes

**Why Double-Pole Everything?**
- In caravan parks, you can't guarantee which wire is active/neutral
- Some sites may have reversed polarity
- Double-pole switches ensure both wires disconnect
- Safety requirement in AS/NZS 3001.2

**AC vs DC Separation:**
- Keep AC and DC wiring 50cm apart minimum
- Never share conduit
- Prevents electromagnetic interference
- Safety requirement

## 10. 12V Wiring Planning (Detailed Guide)

### Overview

This section covers planning and installing 12V accessories beyond your existing battery system (which is already done). Focus is on lighting circuits, USB outlets, and other 12V accessories.

### Step 1: Create Zone Map

Draw your van layout and identify lighting/accessory zones:

**Example Zones:**
1. **Ceiling/Overhead** - Main downlights for general illumination
2. **Kitchen Area** - Task light over counter, LED strip under cabinets
3. **Bed Area** - Reading lights on both sides
4. **Work/Desk Area** - Bright task light + USB outlets
5. **Ambient/Accent** - LED strips (optional, adds atmosphere)
6. **Exterior** - Step/entry light, awning light (optional)

**Your Specific Needs:**
- How many downlights in ceiling? (typically 4-8 for a van)
- Reading lights at bed? (1-2, one per person)
- Kitchen task lighting?
- Work desk light?
- USB charging points? (bedside, desk, kitchen)

### Step 2: Component Count & Power Calculation

Create a table like this:

| Zone | Component | Qty | Watts Each | Total Watts | Amps @12V |
|------|-----------|-----|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Ceiling | LED downlights (3W) | 6 | 3W | 18W | 1.5A |
| Kitchen | LED strip (7W/m) | 2m | 7W/m | 14W | 1.2A |
| Kitchen | Task light | 1 | 3W | 3W | 0.25A |
| Bed | Reading lights | 2 | 3W | 6W | 0.5A |
| Desk | Task light | 1 | 5W | 5W | 0.4A |
| Desk | USB outlets (2.4A x2) | 2 | 12W | 24W | 2A |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **70W** | **5.85A** |

**Calculation:** Amps = Watts ÷ 12V

**Your System Impact:**
- 400Ah battery bank
- 6A continuous draw = 67 hours runtime
- Realistically: Lights used 4-6 hours/day = minimal impact
- Solar recharges during day

### Step 3: Circuit Design

**Group components into circuits** (each circuit = one fuse + switch):

**Circuit 1: Main Overhead Lights**
- All 6 ceiling downlights
- Wire: 14 AWG (red positive, black negative)
- Fuse: 5A
- Switch: 1x dimmer switch near entry door
- Total draw: 1.5A

**Circuit 2: Kitchen Lights**
- LED strip + task light
- Wire: 14 AWG
- Fuse: 5A
- Switch: 1x rocker switch at kitchen counter
- Total draw: 1.4A

**Circuit 3: Bed & Desk Lights**
- 2x bedside reading lights + 1x desk light
- Wire: 14 AWG
- Fuse: 5A
- Switches: Individual at each location
- Total draw: 0.9A

**Circuit 4: USB Outlets (Always-On)**
- 2x USB dual-port outlets
- Wire: 14 AWG
- Fuse: 10A
- No switch (always powered)
- Total draw: Up to 2A per outlet (4A max)

**Circuit 5: 12V Accessory Outlets**
- 1-2x cigarette lighter style outlets
- Wire: 14 AWG
- Fuse: 15A
- Switch or always-on (your choice)
- For: fans, phone chargers, 12V appliances

### Step 4: Wire Routing Plan

**Main Power Path:**
```
Battery (+/-)
    ↓
Bus Bars (you have these)
    ↓
12-Circuit Fuse Panel (need to install)
    ↓
Individual circuits to zones
```

**Physical Routing:**
1. Mount fuse panel near battery/accessory box (accessible location)
2. Run positive wires from fuse panel to switch locations
3. Run negative wires from fuse panel to ground bar or direct to ground
4. From switches, run wires to lights
5. Wire lights in parallel (not series)

**CRITICAL: Do this BEFORE wall panels!**

**Routing Tips:**
- Follow van ribs or furring strips
- Use cable clips every 300mm to secure
- Keep wires tidy and bundled
- Label both ends of every wire (masking tape + marker)
- Leave 300mm extra at each end for connections
- Avoid sharp metal edges (use grommets if passing through metal)
- Keep 12V wiring away from 240V wiring (50cm minimum)

### Step 5: Calculate Wire Lengths

**Measure each circuit route:**

**Example - Circuit 1 (Ceiling Lights):**
- Fuse panel to first light: 3m
- Between 6 lights in parallel: 5m total
- To switch location: 2m
- Add 20% contingency: (3+5+2) x 1.2 = 12m
- **Buy: 15m of red + 15m of black (14 AWG)**

**Do this for all 5 circuits, sum up total wire needed**

**Typical Van Total:**
- Red 14 AWG: 40-60 meters
- Black 14 AWG: 40-60 meters
- Buy in bulk spools from Jaycar

### Step 6: Switch Placement Planning

**Primary Switch Panel (Near Entry Door):**
- Main overhead lights (dimmer switch)
- Kitchen lights (rocker switch)
- Exterior lights if installed (rocker switch)
- Mount in wall panel at comfortable height (~1.5m)

**Point-of-Use Switches:**
- Bedside: Individual switches for reading lights
- Desk: Switch for task light
- These can be inline switches on wire OR wall-mounted

**Switch Panel Layout:**
- Use project box or make custom panel from wood
- Drill holes for switches
- Mount to furring strip or wall panel
- Label each switch clearly

### Step 7: Fuse Panel Selection & Installation

**Fuse Panel Options:**

**Option A: Blue Sea Systems 12-Circuit (RECOMMENDED)**
- Quality marine-grade panel
- 12 circuits with individual blade fuses
- Built-in bus bars
- Cover protects fuses
- Cost: ~$80-150
- Available: Online (marine suppliers, eBay AU)

**Option B: Budget Blade Fuse Panel**
- 12-way automotive fuse box
- Cost: ~$30-50
- Available: eBay, Jaycar, auto parts stores
- Less robust but adequate

**Installation Location:**
- Inside a cabinet with access panel (protected but accessible)
- Under a seat in a covered box
- Near your existing 12V accessory box
- Label every circuit clearly

**Connection:**
- Large positive wire (10 AWG or thicker) from positive bus bar to fuse panel input
- Large negative wire from negative bus bar to fuse panel ground
- Each circuit wire connects to individual fuse position

### Step 8: Parallel Wiring for Lights

**How to Wire Lights in Parallel:**

```
Switch (+) ───┬─── Light 1 (+)
              ├─── Light 2 (+)
              ├─── Light 3 (+)
              └─── Light 4 (+)

Ground (-) ───┬─── Light 1 (-)
              ├─── Light 2 (-)
              ├─── Light 3 (-)
              └─── Light 4 (-)
```

**Why Parallel:**
- All lights get full 12V
- If one fails, others still work
- Easier to calculate load

**Connection Methods:**

**Option A: Wago Connectors**
- Push-in wire connectors
- Reusable
- No crimping required
- Good for parallel connections
- Cost: $5-10 for assortment

**Option B: Crimp Connectors**
- Butt connectors to join wires
- Ring terminals for ground connections
- Requires crimping tool
- Most permanent
- Use heat shrink over connections

**Option C: Solder + Heat Shrink**
- Most reliable
- Requires soldering iron + skill
- Time consuming
- Best for permanent install

**RECOMMENDED: Wago connectors for lights, crimp for power connections**

### Step 9: Installation Sequence

**BEFORE Panelling (Critical Steps):**
1. Install furring strips to van ribs (your 11mm ply)
2. Mount fuse panel in chosen location
3. Run thick power cables (10 AWG) from bus bars to fuse panel
4. Mark switch locations on furring strips
5. Drill holes through furring for wires
6. Run all circuit wires from fuse panel along furring strips
7. Secure wires with cable clips every 300mm
8. Label wire ends clearly (Circuit 1 Ceiling +, Circuit 1 Ceiling -, etc.)
9. Leave loops of wire at light locations
10. Take photos for reference
11. Test continuity with multimeter (no shorts)

**AFTER Panelling:**
1. Install wall panels (your 3mm ply)
2. Cut holes for switch locations in panels
3. Cut holes for light locations in ceiling panels
4. Pull wires through switch holes
5. Install switches in wall panels
6. Connect switches (positive in, positive out to lights)
7. Pull wire loops through light holes
8. Install lights
9. Connect lights in parallel at each location
10. Connect ground wires to common ground or ground bar

**Testing:**
1. Insert fuse for Circuit 1
2. Test Circuit 1 only (leave other fuses out)
3. Check for proper operation, no sparks
4. If good, test Circuit 2
5. Continue for all circuits
6. Check for voltage drop (should be <0.5V at furthest light)
7. Let all circuits run for 30 minutes, check for heat at connections

### Step 10: Switch Wiring Examples

**Simple On/Off Switch (SPST):**
```
Fuse Panel (+) ──► Switch ──► Lights (+)

Ground (-) ──────────────────► Lights (-)
```

**Dimmer Switch:**
```
Fuse Panel (+) ──► Dimmer ──► Lights (+)

Ground (-) ──────────────────► Lights (-)
```
*Note: Not all LED lights are dimmable - check specs*

**Two-Way Switch (Control from 2 locations):**
- More complex wiring
- Use SPDT switches
- See tutorial links in Section 1

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not running wires before panelling** - Must do wiring first!
2. **Undersized wire** - Use 14 AWG for lights, 10 AWG for heavy loads
3. **No fuses** - Every circuit needs a fuse
4. **Series wiring** - Always use parallel for lights
5. **Poor connections** - Use proper connectors, not twist + tape
6. **No labeling** - Label everything or you'll forget what's what
7. **Sharp edges** - Protect wires from metal edges (they'll chafe and short)
8. **Voltage drop** - Long wire runs need thicker wire
9. **Mixing AC and DC** - Keep 240V and 12V wiring far apart

### Troubleshooting

**Lights don't turn on:**
- Check fuse (blown?)
- Check switch connections (loose?)
- Test voltage at light with multimeter (getting 12V?)
- Check polarity (red to +, black to -)

**Lights dim:**
- Voltage drop (wire too thin or too long)
- Bad connection (resistance)
- Battery voltage low (charge battery)

**Fuse keeps blowing:**
- Short circuit somewhere (wire touching metal)
- Overloaded circuit (too many watts on one fuse)
- Wrong fuse size (too small)

**Lights flicker:**
- Loose connection
- Bad ground
- Dying LED (replace)

## 12. Securing Furniture & Items to Floor

### The Problem

Van life = constant movement, vibration, acceleration, braking, cornering. Everything slides, rattles, and becomes projectile in accident if not secured.

### What Needs Securing

**Critical (Must Secure):**
- Fridge (already installed - verify it's bolted)
- Under-bed drawers or storage units
- Floor-standing cabinets
- Table base (if floor-mounted)
- Water tanks (if interior mounted)
- Anything >5kg

**Important (Should Secure):**
- Portable bins/crates
- Portable toilet
- Tool boxes
- Anything that could cause injury if it moves

**Okay Loose:**
- Pillows, blankets, soft items
- Lightweight bags
- Clothes in drawers (drawers are secured)

### Solution 1: L-Brackets (Best for Large Items)

**For: Drawers, cabinets, large storage units**

**Parts Needed:**
- Heavy duty L-brackets (50-75mm size)
- 2-4 brackets per furniture piece
- Wood screws (25-40mm) for furniture side
- Self-tapping screws (12-16mm) for floor side

**Installation:**
1. Position furniture in final location
2. Mark bracket positions at back corners
3. Pre-drill holes in furniture frame (pilot holes prevent splitting)
4. Pre-drill holes in floor (if wood floor) or use self-tapping screws (if metal)
5. Screw bracket to furniture first
6. Screw bracket to floor
7. Test - furniture shouldn't move at all

**Where to Mount:**
- **Back corners** (2 brackets minimum)
- Leaves front accessible
- For heavy items: Add brackets at front too (4 total)

**Parts:**
- Bunnings: Heavy duty L-brackets (zinc or stainless) $3-5 each
- Pack of 50mm L-brackets (4 pack) ~$12-15

**Pros:**
- Very secure
- Relatively easy
- Furniture can still be removed (just unscrew)
- Low profile

**Cons:**
- Puts screw holes in floor (can fill later if needed)
- Visible brackets

### Solution 2: Floor Cleats (Removable Furniture)

**For: Items you want to remove occasionally**

**Parts Needed:**
- Pine 50x50mm or 75x75mm offcuts
- Wood screws

**Installation:**
1. Measure furniture base dimensions
2. Cut cleats to create a "frame" around furniture
3. Screw cleats to floor
4. Furniture sits inside cleat frame (can't slide)
5. Can lift furniture out without unscrewing anything

**Pros:**
- Furniture completely removable
- No screws through furniture
- Can reposition by moving cleats

**Cons:**
- Cleats visible and take floor space
- Furniture can still bounce up slightly

### Solution 3: Rubber Mat + Minimal Brackets (Hybrid)

**For: Medium-weight items that generate noise/vibration**

**Parts Needed:**
- Thick rubber mat or foam (5-10mm)
- 2x L-brackets at back

**Installation:**
1. Cut rubber mat to furniture base size
2. Place under furniture
3. Install 2x L-brackets at back corners only

**Pros:**
- Reduces vibration noise significantly
- Mat prevents sliding somewhat
- Brackets ensure it can't move
- Protects floor

**Cons:**
- Rubber mat can be expensive
- Still need brackets for security

**Parts:**
- Bunnings: Rubber matting (roll or offcuts) ~$20-40
- Clark Rubber: Foam matting

### Solution 4: Ratchet Straps (Temporary/Removable)

**For: Portable items, temporary setups**

**Parts Needed:**
- D-rings or eye bolts screwed to floor
- Ratchet straps

**Installation:**
1. Install D-rings in floor at strategic locations
2. Position furniture
3. Ratchet strap over furniture to D-rings

**Pros:**
- Completely removable
- No modification to furniture
- Can adjust or remove anytime

**Cons:**
- Industrial look
- Have to unstrap to access drawers
- Straps can loosen over time

**Use Case:**
- Test layouts before permanent mounting
- Truly temporary setups

### Solution 5: Bolt Through Floor (Most Secure)

**For: Critical items (fridge, water tanks)**

**Parts Needed:**
- M6 or M8 bolts + washers + lock nuts
- Large washers (spread load on underside)

**Installation:**
1. Identify safe drilling location (avoid fuel lines, brake lines underneath!)
2. Drill through floor and furniture mounting feet
3. Insert bolt from top
4. Add large washer underneath floor
5. Thread lock nut on bottom
6. Tighten (access from underneath van)

**Pros:**
- Most secure possible
- Can't come loose

**Cons:**
- Holes in floor (potential leak point)
- Requires access underneath van
- Permanent (harder to remove)

**Use Only For:**
- Fridge (often has mounting feet designed for this)
- Large floor-mounted cabinets
- Water tanks

### Specific Items

**Under-Bed Drawers:**
- Solution 1 (L-Brackets) at back corners
- 2 brackets minimum, 4 if very heavy
- Add rubber mat underneath to reduce rattle

**Floor Cabinets:**
- Solution 1 (L-Brackets) at all 4 corners if heavy
- OR bolt through floor if permanent

**Portable Bins:**
- Solution 2 (Cleats) if you remove them often
- OR bungee cord/cargo net system across shelf opening

**Table (if floor-mounted):**
- Your Lagun table mounts to B-pillar, not floor
- Base stays mounted permanently

**Portable Toilet:**
- Solution 2 (Cleats) or dedicated storage locker
- Needs to be removable for emptying

**IKEA Bed Frame:**
- L-brackets at 4 corners of base frame
- Prevents frame sliding
- Mattress stays put with frame secured

### Anti-Rattle Tips

Beyond securing (preventing movement), also reduce rattles:

**1. Rubber/Foam Padding:**
- Between furniture and floor
- Between drawers and cabinet sides
- Anywhere two hard surfaces meet

**2. Felt Pads:**
- On drawer bottoms
- On cabinet doors
- On anything that touches another surface

**3. Latch Systems:**
- Drawers: Push-to-open latches OR magnetic catches
- Cabinets: Magnetic or roller-ball catches
- Prevents doors/drawers opening while driving

**4. Item Retention:**
- Bungee cords across openings
- Cargo nets
- Dividers inside drawers
- Nothing loose inside secured furniture

### Parts Shopping List

**From Bunnings:**
- Heavy duty L-brackets 50-75mm (pack of 4) = $12-15
- Need 2-4 packs depending on furniture quantity
- Wood screws assortment = $10-15
- Self-tapping screws = $8-12
- Rubber matting (if using) = $20-40
- Pine offcuts for cleats (if using) = $10-20
- M6/M8 bolts, washers, lock nuts (if using) = $10-20
- D-rings or eye bolts (if using straps) = $5-10 each

**Total: $50-150** depending on how much furniture you have

### Installation Priority

**Secure First:**
1. Fridge (critical - heavy and could cause injury)
2. Under-bed drawers/storage (likely heaviest floor item)
3. Floor-standing cabinets
4. Water tanks (when installed)

**Secure Second:**
5. Bins and crates (bungee system)
6. Portable toilet (cleats or locker)
7. Tool storage

**Ongoing:**
- Test over first few drives
- Tighten anything that loosens
- Add padding where you hear rattles
- Adjust as needed

### Safety Note

In a collision, unsecured items become projectiles:
- 5kg object at 50km/h = significant force
- Could cause serious injury
- Also damages other things in van
- Many insurance policies require items to be secured

**When in doubt, secure it down.**
